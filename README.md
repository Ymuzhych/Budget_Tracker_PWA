## Description:
Budget Tracker is a progressive web application that allows users to track their budgets by adding expenses and deposits to their budget through the "Add/Subtract Funds" buttons. They are able to add a transaction with or without a connection. When a user enters a transaction while offline, these transactions are stored in the indexedDB, and transferred to the database when the user comes back online.

## Acceptance Criteria:

 - GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection

- WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit

- THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit

- WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection

 - THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated
